# CodeSnack IDE Feature Requests

This repository is used to track CodeSnack IDE feature requests and discussions.

This repository is used to track [CodeSnack IDE](https://www.codesnack-ide.com) feature requests and discussions. Click [here](https://github.com/mobibean/codesnack-ide-feature-requests/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to open a new feature request.

Note: CodeSnack IDE bugs are tracked in the [CodeSnack IDE repo issue tracker](https://github.com/mobibean/codesnack-ide-issues/issues).

## Suggesting Features

Many of the features in CodeSnack IDE came from suggestions by you, the community! We welcome any ideas about how to make our product better for your use case. Unless there is overwhelming demand for a feature, it might not get implemented immediately, but please include as much information as possible that will help people have a discussion about your proposal:

1. **Use case:** What are you trying to accomplish, in specific terms? Often, there might already be a good way to do what you need and a new feature is unnecessary, but itâ€™s hard to know without information about the specific use case.

2. **Is there a workaround?** Is this a more convenient way to do something that is already possible, or is there some blocker that makes a workaround unfeasible?

Please keep in mind that feature requests should be well specified and unambiguous, to have the greatest chance of being worked on by a developer.

The [issues](https://github.com/mobibean/codesnack-ide-feature-requests/issues/) area of this repo should be used to discuss new features and possible implementation designs. You can show your support for (or against!) features by using GitHub reactions, or by adding meaningful details which help the feature definition become more clear. Please do not comment with "+1" as it creates a lot of noise (e-mails, notifications, etc.).
